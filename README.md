Prepare environment for installing Ruby, Rails, and other tools, then download and install Ruby/Rails/Tools.

Note : This script sets a custom prompt, but the prompt doesn't appear until the next time the user logs-in. If you don't like the prompt, remove the line this script added to the end of .bashrc, the line beginning with "export PS1"
