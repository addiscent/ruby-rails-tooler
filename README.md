# ruby-rails-tooler.sh
This is a Bash script written for and tested on Ubuntu (16.04).  It prepares the host for installing Ruby, Rails, and other tools, then downloads and installs Ruby/Rails/Tools.

Note : This script sets a custom prompt, but the prompt doesn't appear until the next time the user logs-in. If you don't like the prompt, remove the line this script adds to the end of .bashrc, the line beginning with "export PS1".
